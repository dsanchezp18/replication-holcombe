# Replicating Holcombe & Boudreaux (2015) [*Regulation & Corruption*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-015-0263-x)

This repository replicates the paper *Regulation & Corruption* by Holcombe & Boudreaux (2015). Please refer to the main script, `script replicando.R` to run everything and replicate the various regressions in the paper. My comments are in Spanish, but ChatGPT can easily translate them with the RStudio addin. 

I use data from a later year to replicate the author's results. All in all, must results seem pretty robust. You can download most of the data from the World Bank's website or API. Consult the paper itself to see where to get the other data (it has good references).
